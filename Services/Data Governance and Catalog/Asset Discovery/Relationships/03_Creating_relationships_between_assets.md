# Creating relationships between assets

You can create relationships between assets to indicate dependency or linkage between assets.

For information about the types of relationships that you can create between different asset types, see [Relationships](../aa-asset-discovery/Relationships.html). To add relationships for assets, perform the following steps:

1. Open the business asset for which you want to create a relationship. 
2. Go to the **Relationships** tab, and click the add icon.
3. Select **Add Relationships** from the drop-down menu.

   The **Add Relationships** wizard opens.

4. In the **Select Assets** step, select one or more assets that you want to relate to the open asset, depending on the asset type for which you are creating relationships. To narrow the list of assets, you can enter an asset name in the **Search** field, or click **Filters** to select one or more asset types. For information about how you can search for assets, see [Search for assets](../aa-asset-discovery/Search_for_assets.html). ![Image depicting the Select assets step in the Add Relationships wizard.](../aa-asset-discovery/images/GUID-F6659E8A-688C-4863-8B8A-84EC07D76C65-low.png) 

5. Click **Next**.

6. In the **Assign Relationships** step, for each asset that you want to relate, specify the type of direct relationship that you want to create between the open asset and the selected assets. ![Image depicting the Assign Relationships step in the Add Relationships wizard.](../aa-asset-discovery/images/GUID-F416D56B-069E-4610-A64A-BDD97B70FFCF-low.png)

7. Click **Finish** to save the relationships and the relationships appears in the **Relationships** tab. For information about viewing relationships, see [View relationships in assets](../aa-asset-discovery/View_relationships_in_assets.html). 

## Add relationships between data classifications and policy assets

You can add relationships between data classifications and policy assets.

You can add a relationship between data classifications and policy assets if your organization administrator grants you the **Read** permission on data classification assets and the **Update** permission on policy assets through access policies in Metadata Command Center.

To add this relationship, perform the following steps:

1. Open the policy asset for which you want to manually associate data element and entity classifications. 
2. Go to the **Relationships** tab of the policy page, and click the add icon.

   The **Add Relationships** wizard opens.

3. In the **Select Assets** step, click the filter icon and then click **Add Filter**.
4. Select **Data Element Classification** and **Data Entity Classification** from the **Asset Type** dropdown.

   The grid displays assets that are of the data element and entity classification asset type. The **Sensitivity** column displays the sensitivity level of each data classification asset.![Image depicting the Add Relationships wizard.

   The relationships appear on the **Relationships** tab of the policy asset page. For information about viewing relationships, see [View relationships in assets](../aa-asset-discovery/View_relationships_in_assets.html).

Users can search for the data element or entity classifications related to policy asset or based on sensitivity by entering the required search terms. See [Search query examples](../aa-asset-discovery/Search_for_assets.html#ww3_6_11_14_1).

## Add relationships between data classifications with glossary assets

You can add relationships between data classifications and glossary assets. When you add relationships between glossary assets and data classifications, you can easily establish the relationships between the glossary and data elements that were discovered and associated with data entity and data element classifications. The relationships between the glossary assets and data classifications can be made only from the glossary asset pages and not vice versa.

You can add a relationship between data classifications and glossary assets if your organization administrator grants you the **Read** permission on data classification assets and the **Update** permission on glossary assets through access policies in Metadata Command Center.

After you have added the relationship, you must run the Glossary Association job for the catalog sources in Metadata Command Center to link the data elements to the glossary.

To associate data element and data entity classifications to a glossary asset, perform the following steps:

1. Open the glossary asset to which you want to associate data element and entity classifications. 
2. Go to the **Relationships** tab of the glossary metric or the business term page and click the add icon.

   The **Add Relationships** wizard opens.

3. In the **Select Assets** step, click the filter icon and then click **Add Filter**.
4. Select **Data Element Classification** and **Data Entity Classification** from the **Asset Type** dropdown.

   The grid displays the data element and entity classification asset types. ![Image depicting the Data Element Classification and Data Entity Classification asset types in the Add Relationships wizard.](../aa-asset-discovery/images/GUID-735F28B9-FB3C-49FB-8951-DD01990E880F-low.png)

5. Select one or more required data element and entity classification assets, and click **Next**.

   The **Assign Relationships** page appears. ![Image depicting the assign relationships page](../aa-asset-discovery/images/GUID-A8C7A335-2F1A-42AB-A44B-83C660E305EC-low.png)

6. On the **Relationship** field, select the type of relationship you want to establish between each data classification and the glossary asset.
7. Click **Next**.

On the **Next Step** page, click **Finish** to add the relationship between the glossary asset and the selected data classifications.

You can see the relationship between the glossary asset and the discovered data elements on the **Relationships** tab of the asset page only after the **Glossary Association** job for the catalog sources is run in Metadata Command Center. The glossary association job can be run manually in Metadata Command Center or is run automatically based on next schedule. Users can search for the data element or entity classifications related to assets. For information about how you can search for assets, see [Search query examples](../aa-asset-discovery/Search_for_assets.html#ww3_6_11_14_1).
