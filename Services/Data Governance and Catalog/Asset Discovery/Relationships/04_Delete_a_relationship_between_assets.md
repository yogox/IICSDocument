# Delete a relationship between assets
If a relationship between two assets is no longer relevant, you can delete the relationship. You can delete an outbound relationship between the source and target assets. However, you cannot delete an inbound relationship between a related asset and a seed asset. To delete an inbound relationship, you must open the corresponding related asset and delete the relationship between the assets from the Relationships tab.

To delete an outbound relationship between two assets, your organization administrator must grant you the Update permission on the source asset in the relationship through access policies in Metadata Command Center.

Click the grid view icon on the Relationships tab of the asset page. Select the outbound relationship that is no more required and remove the relationship by clicking the Delete icon.

The following image displays the Delete icon on the grid view of the Relationships tab of an asset page:
