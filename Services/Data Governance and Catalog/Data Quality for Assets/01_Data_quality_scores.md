In Data Governance and Catalog, you can view data quality scores for the data in your organization.
If Data Governance and Catalog is integrated with a data quality application, you can define data quality rules in Data Governance and Catalog and associate them with Glossary assets that are linked to technical assets. Although you define the rules in Data Governance and Catalog, the rules are created in the data quality application. Data Governance and Catalog sends the data elements associated with the glossary to the data quality application. After the data quality rules are run on the data elements, Data Governance and Catalog retrieves the data quality scores and displays them in the asset pages. You can also run data quality rules for a catalog source automatically according to the schedule that you define in Metadata Command Center. For more information about running automated data quality rules on Glossary assets, see Defining data quality rules for business assets.
Using the bulk import process to modify data quality scores
You can use the bulk import process to modify the data quality score of a data element that is associated with an asset. You can use this method if you want to update the aggregated data quality score of an asset before its associated data quality rule is next run.
You can also use the bulk import process or run a data quality rule to update the data quality score of a data element that is not linked to any business asset.
