When there is a change in the data quality score for a data quality rule occurrence, Data Governance and Catalog generates a notification and an email alert. You will receive notifications for a data quality rule occurrence status change only if you are assigned as a stakeholder for that rule occurrence.

You can receive notifications for the following changes to the rule occurrences:

* The status changes from good to not acceptable
* The status changes from acceptable to not acceptable
* The status changes from good to acceptable
