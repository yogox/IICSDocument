You can define a data quality rule that you want to run on one or more data elements. The rule is run in the data quality application that is integrated with Data Governance and Catalog. After the rule is run and the results are ready, Data Governance and Catalog retrieves the rule scores and displays the results in graphical formats. You can also specify target and threshold values to categorize rule results as Good, Acceptable and Not Acceptable. For the catalog sources that you configure in Metadata Command Center, you can retrieve the data quality scores for the technical assets associated with the catalog source. You can disable the running of data quality rules for a catalog source in Metadata Command Center.
