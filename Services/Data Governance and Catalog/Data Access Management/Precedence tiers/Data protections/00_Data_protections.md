You can define data protections within a data de-identification policy's rules to protect data while maintaining data consistency, reversibility, and format.

Data de-identification techniques are behaviors for Data Access Management to apply to a field in a data set to de-identify it, while still preserving data utility.

Data de-identification techniques include:

- Replace a string with a Constant value
- Generalize date
- Hashing
- Redact with null
- Retain
- Substitute value
- Tokenize a string or integer
- Truncate a string
