Once you create a data access asset, such as a data access policy, a precedence tier, or a data protection, you can publish it. When you edit a published data access asset, Data Access Management creates a draft copy of it. The published version remains active until you publish the draft version.

Data access assets can have the following statuses:

* Draft: A user has not yet published the data access asset or there is a new draft copy of the data access asset following an edit.

  It is inactive.

* Published: A user has published the data access asset.

  It is active if other criteria are also true. Depending on the asset type, these criteria include effective dates, enabled, and policy conditions.
