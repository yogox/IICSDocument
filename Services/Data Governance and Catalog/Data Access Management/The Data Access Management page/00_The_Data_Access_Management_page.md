Data Access Management > The Data Access Management page

Use the Data Access Management page to build policy-based data access controls and protections into data operations to enable efficient, effective, and responsible data use.

You can use the Data Access Management page to develop policies that can be applied within data operations through Data Integration, self-service access through Data Marketplace, or push down to cloud data platforms. This way, you can protect and deliver safe data that is fit for use by easily constructing policies that leverage metadata conditions for transforming and delivering data.
