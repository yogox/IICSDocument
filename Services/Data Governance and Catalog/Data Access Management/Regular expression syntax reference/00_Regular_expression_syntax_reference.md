You use a regular expression-style syntax to define the format of the input values and output tokens that Data Access Management processes when you use the tokenize data de-identification technique. Read this chapter to understand the syntax and see examples of how to use it.

Since you only use the regular expression to define and match the format of a string, and not for extracting portions of it, the regular expression syntax that you use does not support all of the constructs available in other regular expression syntaxes.
