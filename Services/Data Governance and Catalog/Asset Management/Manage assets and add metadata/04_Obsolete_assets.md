If some business assets are no longer of active interest to the organization, you can manually change the lifecycle status of such business assets to `Obsolete`. You can use these assets to generate reports for audits. You can make the lifecycle status of an asset to `Obsolete` only when the asset is in `Published` lifecycle status and not in `Draft` or `In Review` lifecycle status.

When the lifecycle status of an asset changes from `Published` to `Obsolete`, the existing recommended glossary associations are deleted.

You can take the following actions on obsolete assets if your organization administrator has granted you the **Update** permission on the asset through access policies in Metadata Command Center:

* View and change the description of the obsolete asset.
* Delete an existing relationship of the obsolete asset.
* Update the stakeholders for the obsolete asset.
* Add comments to the obsolete assets.

If your organization administrator grants you the **Manage Access** permission on the asset, you can assign a stakeholder for the asset and modify the asset groups for the asset.

However, you cannot take the following actions on obsolete assets:

* Add a new relationship to the obsolete asset.
* Create tickets for obsolete assets.
* Update the lifecycle status of data quality rule occurrences and data quality rule templates to `Obsolete`.
* Add new data elements to a data set.
