Predefined access policies provide an extension of the access privileges that the organization administrator provides through user roles in Administrator. To perform cataloging and governance tasks, the administrator must assign the predefined access policies to user roles and stakeholder roles in Metadata Command Center.

The predefined access policies have a set of predefined rules that grants different levels of access to users based on the user roles or stakeholder roles assigned to the users. You cannot modify the predefined access policies but you can disable and clone them to create custom access policies that are specific to your organization.

To view all the predefined access policies, go to the Access Policies tab on the Access Control page in Metadata Command Center, and apply the filter on Category.

The following table lists the predefined access policies that are enabled and disabled by default:
