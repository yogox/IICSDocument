# Comparing data collections

On the Compare page, you can compare data collections to determine the collection that best suits your needs.

The following image shows three data collections on the Compare page:

**As a Data User, how does the compare feature benefit me?**

As a Data User, when more than one data collection seems to meet your requirements, you can use the compare feature to select the most suitable collection among the ones that you have identified.

**As a stakeholder, how does the compare feature benefit me?**

As a stakeholder of a data collection, you can use the compare feature to determine the degree of similarity between the data collection for which you are responsible and the other collections in Data Marketplace. When you discover a data collection that is very similar to a collection that you own, you can link the collection that you identified to your own data collection. This improves the data discovery experience for Data Users. For more information about how you can link similar data collections, see Linking data collections.

**How do I compare data collections?**

To compare data collections, verify one of the following prerequisites:

- Your user profile is assigned at least one of the predefined roles for Data Marketplace. For more information about the predefined roles for Data Marketplace, see the Predefined roles topic in the Introduction and Getting Started help.
- Your user profile is assigned a role for which the following privileges and permissions are enabled:
  - Access Data Marketplace privilege is enabled in Administrator.
  - Read permission is enabled in Metadata Command Center for categories, data assets, data collections, delivery targets, terms of use and usage contexts.

Use the Compare button to add a data collection to the Compare page. You can choose between data collections based on stakeholdership, categorization, certified use and delivery options. You can also use statistics around recent orders and average delivery time for comparing data collections, and also compare the data assets that the data collections contain. If your Administrator has configured custom attributes in Metadata Command Center for data collections in Data Marketplace, you can view additional fields in the Additional Information section and use these fields as another point of comparison.

**Note:** As a Data User, you cannot add an unpublished data collection to the Compare page. As a stakeholder, you can add an unpublished data collection to the Compare page only if you are responsible for the unpublished data collection.
