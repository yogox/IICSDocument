As a stakeholder of a data collection, you can link data collections with each other so that Data Users have a wider choice of related collections that they can access.

To perform this task, verify one of the following prerequisites:

* Your user profile is assigned the Data Marketplace Administrator role.
* You are either an inherited or specifically assigned stakeholder with one of the following stakeholder roles on the data collection:
  - Data Owner
  - Category Owner
* You are assigned as a stakeholder on the data collection and your user profile is assigned a role for which the following privileges and permissions are enabled:
  - Access Data Marketplace privilege is enabled in Administrator.
  - Read and Update permissions are enabled in Metadata Command Center for categories, data collections and usage contexts.

1. Open a data collection. 

   For more information about how you can find a data collection, see Browsing for data collections.

2. In the Similar Data section on the Summary tab of the data collection page, click Link Similar Data.

3. In the Link similar Data Collections dialog box, find similar data collections that you want to link to your data collection, and select them.

   The following table describes the fields that you can view in the Link similar Data Collections dialog box:

   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | Name | Name of the data collection. |
   | Purpose | Purpose of the data collection as specified a stakeholder of the data collection. |
   | Rating | Average rating of the data collection. |
   | Category | Name of the category of the data collection. |
   | Certified Use | The uses for which the data is best suited as specified by the stakeholders of the data collection. |

   **Note:** When you link data collections, consider the following:
   - You can link an unpublished data collection to the collection for which you are responsible. However, you cannot click the unpublished data collection to navigate to its details page if you are not its stakeholder.
   - If a data collection is added to an asset group for which you aren't assigned the required permissions, the Data Collections grid won't display the data collection. For more information about asset groups, see the Implement access controls on metadata topic in the Set Up Data Marketplace help.

4. Click Link.

The data collections that you linked appear in the Similar Data section on the Summary tab of the data collection page. When you link similar data collections, it helps Data Users to discover these data collections easily. If the Similar Data section contains an unpublished data collection, you cannot click it to navigate to the details page of the unpublished collection if you are not its stakeholder.

You can use the compare feature to determine the degree of similarity between the data collection that you own and the other collections in Data Marketplace. For more information about you can compare data collections, see Comparing data collections.
