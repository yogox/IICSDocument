To create a large number of items in Data Marketplace, use the **Bulk Create** option on the New page. According to the item types that you want to create, you can download predefined XLSX template files from Data Marketplace. Enter the values and upload the files to Data Marketplace.

You can also use a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet from your computer to bulk create items in Data Marketplace. Data Marketplace reads the data in the template file or your own Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to create the new items.

**Note:** Informatica recommends you to use the predefined XLSX template files that you can download from Data Marketplace.
