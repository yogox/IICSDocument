**Prerequisites**

To perform this task, verify the following prerequisites:

- Your user profile is assigned one of the following roles:
  ▪ Technical Administrator
  ▪ Data Marketplace Administrator
- Your user profile is assigned a role for which the View Set up page and Configure and Manage Data Marketplace privileges are enabled in Administrator.

In the Custom Labels panel on the Setup > Configuration tab, you can modify the labels of the following Data Marketplace items:

• Category
• Data collection
• Data asset

You can use this feature to customize Data Marketplace to suit the needs of your organization. For example, if your organization uses the term Data Product to represent a collection of data assets, you can modify the label for the Data Marketplace item to Data Product. Doing so will update the item label across the service.

You can also modify the name of your Data Marketplace instance and change the description displayed on the Home page from the Custom Labels panel.
