# Manage stakeholder roles

You can create, modify, or disable stakeholder roles on the Stakeholder Roles tab.

Associate stakeholder roles with asset types and view access policies and assets associated with a stakeholder role on the Stakeholder Roles tab. You cannot delete a stakeholder role that you create.

When you create a stakeholder role, you associate asset types with the stakeholder role. You can then select the role when you assign stakeholders to assets. The stakeholder role replaces the stakeholdership privilege in Data Governance and Catalog.

If the user role corresponding to the stakeholder role is deleted in Administrator, a warning icon appears, and you need to disable the stakeholder role.
