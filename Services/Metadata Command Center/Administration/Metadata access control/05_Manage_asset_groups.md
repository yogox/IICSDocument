# Manage asset groups

You can create, modify, publish, and delete asset groups.

You can manage asset groups on the Asset Groups tab on the Customize page. After you publish an asset group, you can associate access policies and assets with the asset group.

You can't delete parent asset groups that are associated with child asset groups. Also, you can't delete asset groups that are associated with assets or access policies. Remove the associated child asset groups, access policies, or assets before you delete the asset group.
