A catalog source is an object that represents the source system from which you can extract metadata and data facts. Amazon S3 and Oracle are examples of catalog source systems. You can create multiple instances of catalog sources for each catalog source type.
You can create, update, delete, purge, and run a catalog source. At the least, you can perform metadata extraction on a source. You can also perform operations such as data profiling, data classification, relationship discovery, and glossary association on the extracted metadata and data facts. To fine-tune the data, you can apply some filters to exclude certain objects from the run or set a schedule to extract metadata at predefined intervals. You can also assign users, user groups, or roles to catalog sources to grant permissions to manage or update the catalog sources.
Data Governance and Catalog displays the extracted metadata, data facts, and the results of any other capability that was performed on the source.
