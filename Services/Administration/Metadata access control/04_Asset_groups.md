You can use asset groups to control access to a set of assets. By grouping assets, you can use user group policies to grant or restrict access to multiple assets at a time.

For the access policies associated with asset groups to take effect, assign the asset groups to specific assets in Data Governance and Catalog or associate asset groups with assets when you run a catalog source job in Metadata Command Center. After you publish a user group policy that includes asset groups, you can use the access policy to control the access level on assets that are associated with the asset group.

When you create an asset group, you can create a hierarchy of up to four levels by selecting a parent asset group.

The following image shows the Asset Groups tab on the Customize page with a list of hierarchical asset groups in Metadata Command Center:
