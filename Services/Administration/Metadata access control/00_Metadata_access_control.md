Metadata access control allows you to manage how users interact with assets. Access policies control the level of access that users have on assets. You can restrict access and selectively assign access on specific assets to users through access policies.

You can control the visibility of assets or specific attributes on an asset and define permissions that a user can have on assets.

Create and publish access policies to control access to assets and features.

Before you can create an access policy, you need to create users and assign them to user roles and user groups. Also, create asset groups and stakeholder roles.

To create access policies and to understand how to implement access control, you need to understand how to work with roles and the various objects that you create and use in an access policy.

The implementation of metadata access control introduces the following concepts:

* Roles
* Attribute groups
* Asset groups
* Access policies
