Use attribute groups when you define access policies to control access to asset attributes.

The following table describes the attribute groups that you can use:

| Attribute Group | Description |
|---|---|
| Profiling | Attribute group related to basic data profiling results. |
| Data | Attribute group related to advanced data profiling results such as value frequency and min - max values. |
| Code | Attribute group related to the programmatic definition of an asset that you can view on the Code tab for technical assets. |
| Unpublished changes | Attribute group related to assets that are not published during an approval workflow process. |
